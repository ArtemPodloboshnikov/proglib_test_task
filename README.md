Developing a form and sending data to the server.

The form must have fields:

- normal test field (textfield)

- large text field (textarea)

- a field with formatting (entering a phone number or a website url)

- date entry (calendar)

- uploading multiple images with the ability to add, delete, change them

- send button

When you click on the submit button, you need to send the form to the server (any echo server or just to nowhere so that you can check the data in the console) in multipart/form-data encoding
